# network_state_analysis - Network analysis by state arousal 

## Spontenouse Data

* Detection of three states and extraction of time traces of parcels: *scripts/pre_process_spont_animals.m*

* Evaluation of weights matrices for each state, per animal, evaluation of network centrality, plot averaged centralities across animals per state: *scripts/main_network_centrality_evaluateion_spont.m*

## Trial Data

* Detection of three states and extraction of time traces of parcels: *scripts/?.m*

* Evaluation of weights matrices for each state, per animal, evaluation of network centrality, plot averaged centralities across animals per state: *scripts/?.m*
